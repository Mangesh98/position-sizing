    <h2>What Is Position Sizing?</h2>
    <p>
      An investor or trader's position size refers to the number of units they
      have invested in a particular security. It is important to take into
      account an investor's account size and risk tolerance when determining the
      size of a position.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding Position Sizing</h2>
    <p>
      Position sizing refers to the size of a position within a portfolio or the
      amount an investor will invest. In order to maximize returns and control
      risk, investors use position sizing to determine how many units of
      securities they can purchase. Although position sizing applies to most
      investment types, it is most closely associated with day trading and
      currency trading
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite its importance in nearly all investment types, position sizing is most closely associated with day trading and currency trading (forex).

          The concept of position sizing is important in most types of investments, but it is most closely associated with faster-moving investors like currency traders and day traders.

          In spite of proper position sizing, investors may lose more than their specified risk limits if a stock gaps below their stop-loss order.

    <h2>Position Sizing Example</h2>
    <p>
      In order to determine the best position sizing, we must weigh three different factors:
    </p>
    <h4>Account Risk</h4>
    <p>
      Investors must determine their account risk before using appropriate position sizing for a specific trade. Typically, this is expressed as a percentage of the investor's capital. In general, retail investors should not risk more than 2% of their investment capital on any one trade; fund managers usually risk less.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an investor has a $25,000 account and chooses to set their maximum account risk at 2%, they cannot risk more than $500 per trade (2% x $25,000). Despite losing 10 consecutive trades, the investor has only lost 20% of their investment.
    </p>
    <h4>Trade Risk</h4>
    <p>
      The investor must then decide where to place their stop-loss order. In stock trading, the trade risk is the difference between the intended entry price and the stop-loss price, expressed in dollars. As an example, if an investor intends to purchase Apple Inc. at $160 and places a stop-loss order at $140, the trade risk is $20 per share.
    </p>
    <h4>Proper Position Size</h4>
    <p>
      The investor now knows that they can risk $500 per trade and are risking $20 per share. The investor can calculate the correct position size by dividing the account risk, which is $500, by the trade risk, which is $20. In this case, 25 shares can be purchased ($500 / $20).
    </p>
    <h4>Position Sizing and Gap Risk</h4>
    <p>
      In spite of correct position sizing, investors may lose more than their specified account risk limit if a stock gaps below their stop-loss order. To reduce gap risk, investors may want to halve their position size before company earnings announcements.
